# RHActual - Human Resources System

## Project Description

The Human Resources System Project is an initiative developed by students from Universidad Fidélitas for the company Mangueras y Fitinerías S.A. (MAFISA). The main objective is to create a comprehensive system to manage employee information, control vacations, manage permissions, and track personnel actions efficiently. This project is expected to enhance the overall human resources management process at MAFISA.

## Client Information

- **Company Name**: Mangueras y Fitinerías S.A.
- **Sponsor Name**: Erika Loayza Oliden
- **Email**: desarrollohumano@mafisacr.com
- **Project Name**: RHActual

## Project Justification

The selection of this project is based on several factors that have led MAFISA to identify the need to improve their human resources management. The company has experienced significant growth in recent years, leading to an increase in the number of employees and the complexity of their administration. The lack of a centralized and efficient system to manage personnel information, control vacations, permissions, and personnel actions has caused inefficiencies and decision-making difficulties.

This research project will offer new insights into implementing a technology-based human resources system with best practices. Different approaches and technological solutions will be explored to improve human resources management at MAFISA, adapting these solutions to the specific needs of the company.

## Objectives

### General Objective
